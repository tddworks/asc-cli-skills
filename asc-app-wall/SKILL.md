  (2) User asks how to get their apps shown at asccli.app
  (3) User asks what apps.json is for or how the app wall community registry works

# asc app-wall — Submit Your App to the App Wall

Adds your app to the community showcase at [asccli.app/#app-wall](https://asccli.app/#app-wall) by forking `tddworks/asc-cli`, adding your entry to `homepage/apps.json`, and opening a pull request — all in one command.

No ASC authentication required. Only a GitHub token is needed.

## Command

```bash
asc app-wall submit [options]
```

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--developer` | — | Display handle on the card; when omitted, uses iTunes artist name |
| `--developer-id` | ✓* | Apple developer/seller ID — auto-fetches **all** your App Store apps |
| `--app-id` | ✓* | App Store Connect app ID (repeatable) |
| `--github` | — | GitHub username |
| `--x` | — | X/Twitter handle |
| `--app` | ✓* | Specific App Store URL (repeat for multiple) |
| `--github-token` | — | GitHub token (or set `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `gh auth login`) |

_✓* At least one of `--developer-id`, `--app-id`, or `--app` is required — without it there are no apps to display on the wall._

## Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1. Authenticate with GitHub (once)
gh auth login
# or: export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_..."

# 2. Submit — the CLI handles fork + commit + PR automatically
asc app-wall submit \
  --developer "yourhandle" \
  --developer-id "1234567890" \
  --github "yourgithub" \
  --x "yourx" \
  --pretty

# 3. Open the PR in your browser (URL is in the output)
open "https://github.com/tddworks/asc-cli/pull/<number>"
```

## Two Submission Modes

**Mode A — all apps by developer ID** (recommended):
```bash
asc app-wall submit \
  --developer "itshan" \
  --developer-id "1725133580" \
  --github "hanrw"
```
Find your Apple developer ID at `https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/name/id<NUMBER>`.

**Mode B — specific App Store URLs:**
```bash
asc app-wall submit \
  --developer "itshan" \
  --app "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-app/id123456789" \
  --app "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/other-app/id987654321"
```

Both modes can be combined in one command.

## JSON Output

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "affordances": {
        "openPR": "open https://github.com/tddworks/asc-cli/pull/42"
      },
      "developer": "itshan",
      "id": "42",
      "prNumber": 42,
      "prUrl": "https://github.com/tddworks/asc-cli/pull/42",
      "title": "feat(app-wall): add itshan"
    }
  ]
}
```

## What Happens Under the Hood

1. Authenticates with GitHub using your token
2. Forks `tddworks/asc-cli` (idempotent — safe to run multiple times)
3. Syncs the fork to upstream `main`
4. Fetches current `homepage/apps.json` from your fork
5. Checks for duplicate (`developer` field)
6. Creates branch `app-wall/<developer>`
7. Commits updated `apps.json` to that branch
8. Opens a PR against `tddworks/asc-cli:main`

## Error Cases

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `Provide --developer-id or at least one --app URL` | Neither flag supplied | Add `--developer-id` or `--app` |
| `GitHub token required` | No token found | Pass `--github-token`, set `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or run `gh auth login` |
| `Developer X is already listed` | Duplicate `developer` in `apps.json` | Entry already submitted; check existing PR |
| `Timed out waiting for fork` | Fork creation took > 24 seconds | Retry after a moment |
| `GitHub API error (422)` | Branch already exists | Safe to ignore — command continues |

## apps.json Format

The entry added to `homepage/apps.json`:

```json
{
  "developer": "yourhandle",
  "developerId": "1234567890",
  "github": "yourgithub",
  "x": "yourx"
}
```

Nil fields are omitted automatically. After the PR is merged, `fetch-apps-data.js` regenerates `apps-data.json` to pull in your apps from the iTunes API.
