# ScreenPlan JSON Schema

The `ScreenPlan` is the core data structure written by the `asc-app-shots` skill and consumed by `asc app-shots generate`.

## imagePrompt Writing Rules (CRITICAL)

This prompt is sent directly to Gemini image generation along with the actual screenshot.
Write 1-3 concise sentences following this structure:

**Formula:**
```
"Generate a [premium/cinematic/modern] App Store [hero/feature/showcase] screenshot.
The uploaded iPhone UI is displayed in a [style] device mockup [angle] [position].
Bold [color] heading '[EXACT heading text]' [placement], with [color] subtext '[EXACT subheading]' [placement].
[Background: hex color, glow/gradient/particles]. [Atmosphere/quality descriptors]."
```

**Rules:**
1. Always start with "Generate a [adjective] App Store screenshot"
2. Always include **exact heading and subheading text** quoted — Gemini renders them
3. Specify device angle: "centered", "tilted ~8 degrees", "positioned left/right"
4. Include background hex color and lighting effect (radial glow, gradient, bokeh)
5. End with quality/style descriptors: "Minimal, editorial, premium quality"
6. 1-3 sentences max — be concise, let Gemini be creative with composition

**Tips from AppShots:**
- Be concise — 1-3 sentences work best
- Describe the creative perspective and device angle
- Include the heading text you want rendered
- Mention colors, mood, and atmosphere
- Let the AI be creative — don't over-specify
